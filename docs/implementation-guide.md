4. **Customize Project Context**
   Edit `memory-bank/productContext.md` with your project details:
   ```markdown
   ## Vision
   [Your project vision and goals]
   
   ## Success Criteria  
   [Your specific success metrics]
   ```

5. **Start Autonomous Development**
   - Switch to **🧠 Autonomous SPARC Orchestrator** mode
   - Provide your first requirement or feature request
   - Watch the system automatically create specialist tasks

## First Autonomous Workflow Test

### Test Scenario: "Add User Authentication"
1. **Switch to Orchestrator Mode** in Roo Code
2. **Input Request**: "I need to add user authentication to my web application"
3. **Observe Autonomous Behavior**:
   - Specification Writer creates detailed requirements
   - Architect detects security implications → Creates Security Architect task
   - Security Architect identifies auth patterns → Creates Implementation task
   - System coordinates parallel specialist work
   - Quality Coordinator monitors and intervenes as needed

### Expected Autonomous Actions

## Monitoring Autonomous Operation

### Real-Time Dashboards

1. **Workflow State**: `project/<id>/control/workflow-state.json`
   - Active tasks and delegation chains
   - Circuit breaker status
   - Learning state and pattern recognition

2. **Quality Dashboard**: `project/<id>/control/quality-dashboard.json`
   - Overall quality score and trends
   - Domain-specific quality metrics
   - Active quality interventions

3. **Memory Bank Updates**: `memory-bank/`
   - `decisionLog.md`: Autonomous decision tracking
   - `learningHistory.md`: Pattern recognition and learning
   - `progress.md`: Strategic progress updates

### Success Metrics to Track

- **Autonomous Operation**: <1% human intervention rate
- **Quality Consistency**: >0.85 quality score maintenance
- **Development Velocity**: Cycle time improvements
