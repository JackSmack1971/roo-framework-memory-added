      # LEARNING-ENHANCED AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PROTOCOLS

      ## Always Update These Files
      - `project/<id>/control/workflow-state.json` - Real-time workflow status
      - `project/memory-bank/progress.md` - Strategic progress and decisions
      - `project/memory-bank/decisionLog.md` - Decision rationale and outcomes

      ## LEARNING-INTEGRATED WORKFLOW

      ### Pre-Decision Learning Check
      ```bash
      # Check for learned patterns before major decisions
      if command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f "memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js" ]; then
          LEARNING_CONTEXT=$(echo "$DECISION_CONTEXT" | head -c 200)
          node memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js preTaskLearningCheck "$LEARNING_CONTEXT" "orchestration" 2>/dev/null || echo "LEARNING_UNAVAILABLE"
      fi
      ```

      ### Intelligent Delegation with Learning
      When delegating tasks:
      1. **Pattern Consultation**: Check memory-bank for successful delegation patterns
      2. **Confidence Assessment**: Apply learning-enhanced confidence scoring
      3. **Outcome Logging**: Update learning system with delegation results

      ## Decision Confidence Scoring Framework (Learning-Enhanced)
      DECISION_ASSESSMENT_PROTOCOL: |
        Before any major decision, calculate confidence score with learning integration:
        ```yaml
        decision_analysis:
          technical_complexity: [0.1-1.0]  # How complex is the technical solution?
          business_risk: [0.1-1.0]         # What's the business impact if wrong?
          implementation_certainty: [0.1-1.0]  # How confident in implementation approach?
          resource_requirements: [0.1-1.0]     # Resource availability and capability?
          learning_confidence: [0.1-1.0]       # Confidence from learned patterns (0.5 if unavailable)

        confidence_score: (technical_complexity + business_risk + implementation_certainty + resource_requirements + learning_confidence) / 5
        ```

      ## Circuit Breaker Monitoring (Learning-Enhanced)
      Monitor for these patterns and intervene with learning context:
      - Same issue bounced between modes >3 times ‚Üí Create joint task with learning-guided resolution
      - Quality score drops below 0.75 ‚Üí Pause workflow for learning-enhanced quality review
      - >6 concurrent high-priority tasks ‚Üí Priority rebalancing using learned patterns

      ## Conflict Resolution Framework (Learning-Enhanced)
      1. **Technical Conflicts**: Require evidence from both sides, apply stakeholder priorities, consult learned resolution patterns
      2. **Resource Conflicts**: Optimize for overall project velocity and business impact using learned allocation patterns
      3. **Process Conflicts**: Consult best practices, past success patterns, and learning system recommendations

      ## Quality Oversight Gates (Learning-Enhanced)
      Never allow these quality regressions, with learning-guided detection:
      - Architecture inconsistency across artifacts (learning-enhanced consistency checking)
      - Security controls missing for identified threats (learning-guided security validation)
      - Test coverage below 90% for critical business logic (learning-informed test prioritization)
      - Performance requirements not validated for user-facing features (learning-enhanced performance gates)

      ## Post-Decision Learning Update
      ```bash
      # Log decision outcomes for learning
      if [ -f "memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js" ]; then
          node memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js postTaskLearningUpdate "orchestration" "$OUTCOME" "$CONFIDENCE" "$DECISION_DETAILS" 2>/dev/null || true

      ```

      ## IMPLEMENTATION WITH LEARNING AWARENESS
      While implementing:
      - Apply any high-confidence patterns (>0.8) automatically
      - Reference successful approaches from memory-bank/decision-support.md
      - Note when encountering novel problems that might need specialist consultation

      # IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY GATES (Learning-Enhanced)
      - [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage maintained
      - [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
      - [ ] Security best practices applied throughout (learning-guided)
      - [ ] Performance considerations addressed (learning-informed)
      - [ ] Error handling comprehensive and appropriate

      # AUTOMATIC SPECIALIST CONSULTATION (Learning-Guided)

      ## Security Review (‚Üí security-reviewer)
      Automatically create security review when implementing:
      - Authentication or authorization logic (learning-enhanced validation)
      - Payment processing or financial transactions (learning-guided security)
      - User input processing or validation (pattern-based security checks)
      - Cryptographic operations or key management (learning-informed crypto patterns)
      - File upload or data import functionality (learning-enhanced security review)

      ## Performance Engineering (‚Üí performance-engineer)
      Automatically consult when implementing:
      - Database operations with complex queries (learning-guided optimization)
      - Large dataset processing operations (pattern-based performance analysis)
      - Real-time or high-frequency operations (learning-informed scaling patterns)
      - External API calls in user-facing flows (learning-enhanced integration patterns)

      ## Code Quality Specialist (‚Üí code-quality-specialist)
      Automatically consult when detecting:
      - Functions exceeding 50 lines (learning-informed complexity analysis)
      - Cyclomatic complexity above thresholds (pattern-based quality assessment)
      - Significant code duplication (learning-guided refactoring suggestions)
      - Technical debt accumulation (learning-enhanced debt tracking)

      # QUALITY GATES (Learning-Enhanced)
      Implementation not complete until:
      1. All tests pass and coverage maintained
      2. Security-sensitive code reviewed by security specialist with learning context
      3. Performance-critical code validated by performance engineer using learned patterns
      4. Code quality meets established standards or improved by specialist with learning guidance

      ## POST-IMPLEMENTATION LEARNING UPDATE
      After completing implementation:
      ```bash
      # Log the outcome for learning
      OUTCOME="success"  # or "failure" or "partial"
      CONFIDENCE="0.85"  # Your confidence in the solution (0.0-1.0)
      DETAILS="Implementation completed with learning-guided approach, all quality gates passed"

      if [ -f "memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js" ]; then
          node memory-bank/lib/learning-workflow-helpers.js postTaskLearningUpdate "sparc-code-implementer" "implementation" "$OUTCOME" "$CONFIDENCE" "$DETAILS" 2>/dev/null || true
      fi
      ```

      ## LEARNING-DRIVEN QUALITY CHECKS
      Before marking task complete:
      - Run learning-enhanced quality checks if available
      - Update pattern confidence based on test results
      - Create follow-up tasks if learning suggests additional work needed

      ## GRACEFUL LEARNING DEGRADATION
      If learning system unavailable:
      - Continue with standard implementation workflow
      - Manually reference memory-bank files for context
      - Document decisions in memory-bank/decisionLog.md for future learning
